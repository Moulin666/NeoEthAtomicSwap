Proof of concept for atomic swap between NEO and Ethereum

## Abstract
Smart contracts and auxiliary utilities for atomic swap between NEO and Ethereum (Proof of Concept).

At Ethereum side ether has used in atomic swap and at NEO side NEP-5 token has used in atomic swap.

For hashing SHA256 was used in atomic swap.

**DON'T USE IT AT MAINETS! THAT'S PoC REALIZATION!**

## Test at testnets
For testing NEO CoZ testnet and Ethereum Ropsten testnet have used.

Contract at Ropsten address: [0xc6565fbbb826bea5fa25d1400c691d36e0566ce9](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xc6565fbbb826bea5fa25d1400c691d36e0566ce9)

Contract at CoZ testnet address: [Ab38GT9eZGQzV7vX3M53B2FeLUhs9b5XFt](https://coz.neoscan-testnet.io/address/AaEwVEreHF6abZ3PuuovJqafSMFwcMpy6j)

Atomic swap characteristics:
* Swap 1000 AST and 1000 wei
* Secret - "blockchain"
* Secret hash - EF7797E13D3A75526946A3BCF00DAEC9FC9C9C4D51DDC7CC5DF888F74DD434D1
